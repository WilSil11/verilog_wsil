# Verilog Code by Wil

### _Welcome to the project main repository!_
This repository is comprised of code in Verilog for digital circuit designs completed and debugged in Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS environment.

**Please Note: This repository is work in progress! Changes can and _will_ occur! This code and documentation is a demonstration of personal projects.**

## About

This repository is intended for hiring managers who wish to get a deeper look at my competencies and coding style for working with Verilog. Different tasks have been written to demonstrate range/versatility of skill set.

## File Descriptions:

**basic_Circuit**
1. **basic_Circuit:** _Output file for compilation of basic_Circuit.v file._
2. **basic_Circuit.v:** _Verilog file containing code of digital circuit design._
3. **basic_Circuit.vcd:** _Dumpfile that outputs results of synthesized digital circuit._

**my_xor_p**
1. **my_xor_p:** _Output file for compilation of my_xor_p.v file._
2. **my_xor_p.v:** _Verilog file containing code of digital circuit design._
3. **my_xor_p.vcd:** _Dumpfile that outputs results of synthesized digital circuit._
